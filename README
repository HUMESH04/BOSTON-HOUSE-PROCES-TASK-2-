# BOSTON-HOUSE-PROCES-TASK-2-
The Boston House Prices dataset is a widely-used dataset for regression analysis that contains various features of houses in Boston, such as the number of rooms and crime rate, to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes. It is commonly used to practice and evaluate advanced regression techniques.

# Here are the steps to achieve objective:

#1. DATA PREPARATION:
                    Load the dataset.
                    Split it into training and testing sets.
                    
#2. MODEL TRAINING:
                   Train a simple linear regression model on the training data
                   
#3. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION:
                          Evaluate model performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

#4. PREDICTIONS:
               Make predictions on the test set.

#5. VISUALIZATION:
                  Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values.

CONCLUSION : Hence the steps will help you implement a simple linear regression model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results!!
